# Passivity Based Control for VTOL Dynamics
This project cover passivity based control with Interconnection and Damping Assignment of a Mechanical Systems with Underactuation Degree One (VTOL dyamics).

In the matlab file the user is asked to choose one of the scenarios designed. Each scenario has a different starting and desired position for the VTOL. The simulaion includes a simple animation to visualize the VTOL movement.
